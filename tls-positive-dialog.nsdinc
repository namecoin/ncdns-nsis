Only grants ncdns run-time access to a CA constrained to the Namecoin TLD.  If an attacker were able to exploit ncdns, non-Namecoin Internet traffic would be unaffected.  Some already-insecure 3rd-party software might behave insecurely in the presence of ncdns (not an ncdns bug).  Can be shared with other devices."
